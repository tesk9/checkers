## Checkers ##

This checkers game was made for MakerSquare SF's November cohort. This project uses javascript, jQuery, HTML, and css.

Download the project and open index.html in your browser to play. Leave the checkboxes as they are to play against the computer, and with making jumps mandatory. Taunts are irritating--I recommend that you do not check this box. Then press start game to populate the board with pieces.
